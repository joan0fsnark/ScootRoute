## ScootRoute: Maps & Routing App for Scooters
<hr>

Traditional mapping services such as Google Maps and Apple Maps do not allow a scooter rider the ability to filter routes by speed limit. Seeing that electric and small-bore scooters top out at 30-45mph, a road's max speed is a vital piece of information when planning a ride.

### Implementation
I used Python on the back end as a server/router, HERE Maps API for mapping and routing with speed limit filter, and HTML/CSS/Bootstrap for the front end.

### Steps, over 6 weeks:

* Built server and set routes
* Read lots and lots of documentation
* Built a fully-dynamic Google Maps/Directions app with all bells and whistles, but then ran into problems with speed limit filtering
* Tried MapBox, read lots of documentation, ultimately same issue
* Found HERE and fortunately, they have "Scooter Mode", as well as the ability to set a maximum speed for the route
* App takes the user's laptop location and routes to the Hackbright Academy campus in SF

### Next Steps:
* Allow user to customize start/end of journey
* Either: ability to export route to more popular service or figure out how to serve voice directions as a user drives
